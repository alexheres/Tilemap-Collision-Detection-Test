# Tilemap-Collision-Detection-Test
Using a quadtree data structure, and the SFML library for visualization, I have put together an AABB based collision detector. 

Further optimizations are possible, i.e. switching to a K-D tree would likely be faster than using a quadtree. As of now, the project only detects collision for tiles on the screen, and not for tiles outside of it.
